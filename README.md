# releaseman

Your friendly Release helper.

Using this tool is as easy as running `releaseman create` and following the guide
it prints. `releaseman` helps you generating changelog and releasing new version.

**What this tool does:**

1. Generates changelog `releaseman create-changelog`
2. Release new version `releaseman create-release`
3. Generates changelog and release new version `releaseman create`

**What this tool doesn't do:**

1. **Does not push into your git repository, so you can roll back all the changes**

*Roll back:*

* if you want to undo the last commit you can call:
  `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
* to delete tag:
  `$ git tag -d [TAG]`
  `$ git push origin :refs/tags/[TAG]`
* to roll back to the remote state:'
  `git reset --hard origin/[branch-name]`

## Gettings Started

### Install

If you're a Go developer / if you have a `GOPATH` prepared and `GOPATH/bin` in your `PATH`:

```
go get -u github.com/bitrise-tools/releaseman
```

Otherwise:

1. Download the latest release from [https://github.com/bitrise-tools/releaseman/releases](https://github.com/bitrise-tools/releaseman/releases)
1. Save it into a directory which is in your `PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`)
1. `chmod +x /path/to/releaseman`
1. Test that you can run `releaseman` with: `releaseman --version`


### Init

To initialize `releaseman` for your project:

1. In your Terminal / Command Line `cd` into your project's directory
1. Run: `releaseman init` and follow the guide
1. Once you finish with the init you can tweak your `release_config.yml` (generated by `releaseman init`),
   and when you're happy with it `git commit` it into your repository


### Create a release

Once you have your `release_config.yml` in your repository, creating a release is as simple as:

Optional but good to do:

1. (optional - `releaseman` will print an error if you'd have any uncommitted changes)
   Make sure you committed everything, and that your repository is ready for a release (no uncommitted changes)
1. (optional - `releaseman` will prompt you if you're not on this branch)
   `git checkout YOUR-DEVELOPMENT-BRANCH` (where `YOUR-DEVELOPMENT-BRANCH` is the "development" branch you specified
   during `releaseman init` / set as `development_branch` in your `release_config.yml`)

Create the release:

1. `releaseman create` for an automatic version bump
    - or `releaseman create --bump-version="minor"` to bump the "minor" version number
    - or `releaseman create --version X.X.X` to create the version `X.X.X`
1. (optional) check if everything's OK / looks good, and if it does ...
1. `git push`
1. `git push origin : the.tag.version` e.g. `git push origin : 1.0.1`

That's all, you just released a new version, with an auto created CHANGELOG!
